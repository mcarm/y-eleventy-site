            If there is one art form deader than representational art in the eyes of the modern world, it is poetry.\r\n\r\nI have been reading a new biography of Michaelangelo, and another auto-biography of sorts by William Holman Hunt on a the pre-raphealites.Â  One thing that struck me about both, is the influence of poetry on their work and thinking. Michaelangleo even went as far to write sonnets, which are more interesting as insights to his character than as works of art.Â  The pre-Raphalites were influenced by Keats, Shakespeare and the romantics, and several of their best known paintings are scenes from Hamlet and Keat\'s \'Eve of St. Agnes\" . Rossetti of course, published poems as well.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t just know these works, they internalized them and could easily quote them at length.Â  It might even be said that they drew greater inspiration from poetry than the artists around them or their immediate artistic influence.\r\n\r\nIs this one of the \'big\' pieces missing from contemporary representational art and why beauty and depth are lacking? The most you could hope for from a contemporary realist painter is a few lines from a \'classic\' rolling stones song...Â  does this influence the mind\'s ability to conceive of and create beauty?\r\n\r\nThere is certainly some neurological evidence to point in this direction. The book \"The Brain that Changes Itself\"Â  cites cases of boys \'curing\' ADD without drugs by learning to write (by hand) a new alpahbet (such as Urdu) and memorize a long poem.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 1960s, it was common for schoolchildren to be required to learn a long poem. Almost any educated person over 65 can recite, at length a \'classic\'.\r\n\r\nI have a strong hunch that memorizing long meaningful poems (not just gibbberish or shallow rock music lyrics) has a strong organizing effect on the brain andÂ  might enhance creative powers in other disciplines.
