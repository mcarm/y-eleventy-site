            <a href=\"../../assets/uploads/2011/04/church.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1547\" title=\"church\" src=\"../../assets/uploads/2011/04/church.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"242\" height=\"582\" /></a> I have been playing around with <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/TheTrainingOfTheMemoryInArtAndTheEducationOfTheArtist\">LeCoq</a>\'s principles of drawing from memory for some time. It takes consistent practice, but even if you don\'t do the excercises, simply practicing drawing from memory can improve it. I was sitting in church on Sunday, and tried to set to memory this young chorister, which I later drew when I returned home.\r\nOf course, I will never know if it was sucessful, as I have no original to compare it to, but I think it is my best effort at memory drawing to date. Memory drawing has enormous potential for artist- with the ability fully honed, one can \'capture\' scenes without a camera and record them in a way a camera can\'t. Of course the photograph has proved an invalable tool to artists, when used correctly, but often, people rely on it slavishly and in doing so weaken their ability to recall images from memory. It can be likened to transportation - its great to get you places, but if you don\'t still walk and run on a regular basis, you get fat and lazy.
